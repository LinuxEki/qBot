This is rusher AI based on quantumstate's qbot which is (or was) based on the testBot.

Install by placing the files into the data/mods/public/simulation/ai/rusher folder.

If you are developing you might find it helpful to change the debugOn line in qBot.js.  This will make it spew random warnings depending on what I have been working on.  Use the debug() function to make your own warnings.
